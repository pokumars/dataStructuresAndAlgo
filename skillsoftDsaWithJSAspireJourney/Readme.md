DSA with JS
Skillsoft's codecademy aspire journey

About this journey
This Aspire Journey will provide you with the foundational knowledge to understand and implement data structures and algorithms using JavaScript.

In this Journey, you will begin with JavaScript data structures, such as nodes, linked links, queues, and more. Then you will finish off with algorithms such as recursion, bubble sort, searches, and more.


Track 1: JavaScript Data Structures
In this track of the JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms Aspire Journey, the focus will be on implementing and using the following data structures with JavaScript: nodes, linked lists, queues, stacks, hash maps, trees, heaps, and graphs.


Track 2: JavaScript Algorithms
In this track of the JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms Aspire Journey, the focus will be on using and implementing algorithms using JavaScript including: sorting algorithms, searches, trees, and Dijkstra's algorithm.
